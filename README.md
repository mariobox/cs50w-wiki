CS50W Project 1 - Wiki

This is a Django application that generates a Wikipedia-like wiki website. It doesn't use models, just views and templates.
It lets you create and edit wiki entries in Markdown and then generates and displays the pages in HTML.
It has, among other things, search functionality and the ability to generate a random entry.

Here is a video of the finished site at work:
